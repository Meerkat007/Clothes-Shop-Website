# Clothes-Shop-Website

## Description of the project
I am developing a reponsive website using various front-end and back-end technologies. The purpose of this project is to improve my skills in front-end technologies, practice package management using npm and bower, familiarize myself with grunt, yeoman and website deployment workflow, and further my knowledge and experience in back-end technologies. 

In this project, the various building blocks (i.e. html, css, images, and Javascript files) are grouped based on different functionalities.
